It takes about 30 seconds to open the executable file.  
After that, you will need to click on "Open CSV" to select the attached file "a.csv".  
Then, click on "Open Folder" to choose the folder (e.g., 01, 02) where the data for labeling is located, the executable file will iterate through all the images within this folder afterward.
After completing the aforementioned steps, you can begin labeling.  

The steps of labeling are as follows:  
1. Choose a label (Left Eye, Right Eye, Invalid).  
2. Click "Next Image" (When you click "Next Image" the labeling data will be synchronized to both the CSV file and the JSON file.)  
3. Click "Previous Image", it will unlabel the previous image and allow the user to re-label it. (then the labeling data will be synchronized to both the CSV file and the JSON file.)

When you no longer need to use this executable file, you can close it at any time. The next time you run it, you only need to load the previously used CSV file to continue from where you left off in the labeling process. If you need to switch to a different folder of images, you'll need to use a new CSV file (like the original attached file).

Due to time constraints, this executable file does not have error prevention measures. Please strictly follow the steps mentioned above.
